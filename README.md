https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella

## How it works ?

This project uses Node, MySQL2, Express, Sequelize and dotenv. To insure that all dependencies are installed:

1. Run `npm i` before then starting the server
2. log in to mysql via `mysql -u root -p` and run `source db/schema.sql`
3. Next seed our data via `npm run seed`
4. Run `node server` to start exploring at `http://localhost:(your_port)/`

## Demo

Feel free to test endpoints using Insomnia after running the server. Sample endpoint: "http://localhost:3001/api/categories" (GET request)
